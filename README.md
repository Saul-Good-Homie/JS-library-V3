In this project, I am refactoring an existing project. The original project was a simple book library that allows users to enter Book objects with the properties of: Title, Author, Page count and read/not read. The purpose of this new project is to install ES Lint, and practice using javascript/CSS classes to toggle a responsive menu and play with animation.

This is a Javascript project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library)
